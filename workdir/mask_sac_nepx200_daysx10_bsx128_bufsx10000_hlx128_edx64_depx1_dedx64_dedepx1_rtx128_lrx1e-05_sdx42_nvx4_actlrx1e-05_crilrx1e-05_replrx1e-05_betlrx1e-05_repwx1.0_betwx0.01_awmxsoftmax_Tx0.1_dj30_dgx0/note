Input:

Time series data with 99 features over 3 time steps (or 3 features over 99 time steps)
Temporal information (weekday, day of month, month)
Possibly additional contextual information (given the cls_token and other embeddings)
Output:

Representation: 1020 values or classes
Actor: Binary decision (2 possible actions or a single continuous value in range [0,1])
Critic: Similar to actor, but possibly estimating the value of the state-action pair


The representation network creates a rich embedding of the current market state.
The actor network uses this representation to decide whether to buy or sell.
The critic network estimates how valuable that action is expected to be, which can be used to train and improve the actor's decisions over time.
